# Video-Game-Analysis

**Objective:** It is possible to divide data analysis into two fields: Hypothesis Generation and Hypothesis Confirmation (Also called confirmatory analysis). In this project I will deal only with analysis, where the objective is to understand how the data is distributed and generate insight for future decision-making, this analysis aims to explore as much as possible the data in a simple, intuitive and informative way. The data used in this project contains information only from 1980 to 2016. Below is a sketch of all the stages made in these notebooks, following a logical and intuitive sequence to facilitate the understanding of the data.

**Dataset:** The data set used in this project is available in the Kaggle[vgsales.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales). The raw data contains 16598 rows and 11 columns. This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.

### Assumption
**A1:** Are sales for a particular game platform affected by the genre of the game?
**A2:** Is there a correlation between the rating of a game and its sales?
**A3:** Are games with higher production costs more likely to generate higher sales?
**A4:** Does the release year of a game have an impact on its sales?
**A5:** Is there a relationship between the region where a game is released and its sales?
**A6:** Are there specific publishers that consistently produce top-selling games?
**A7:** Is there a difference in sales between games that are exclusive to a particular platform versus those that are released on multiple platforms?
**A8:** Does the presence of multiplayer modes in games impact their sales?
